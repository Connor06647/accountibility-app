# Firebase Admin SDK Setup for Complete User Deletion

## Current Status
✅ **SETUP COMPLETE** - Firebase Admin SDK is configured and active!  
✅ **Complete deletion working** - Removes user data from Firestore AND Firebase Auth  
✅ **Deleted users cannot log back in** - Full security implemented

## ✅ Setup Complete - Already Configured:

### 1. ✅ Service Account Key Generated
- Downloaded from Firebase Console

### 2. ✅ Environment Variables Added
Added to `.env.local` file:

```env
# Firebase Admin SDK Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=autodiscipline
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@autodiscipline.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n[CONFIGURED]\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"

# Admin User Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=cjoliver539@gmail.com
```

### 3. ✅ Values Extracted and Configured
- `project_id` → `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` ✅
- `client_email` → `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` ✅
- `private_key` → `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` ✅

### 4. ✅ Complete Deletion Enabled
API endpoint updated in `AccountabilityApp.tsx`:
```tsx
// Now using complete deletion:
const response = await fetch('/api/admin/delete-user', {
```

## What Changes:

**Before Setup (Current):**
- ✅ Deletes user data from Firestore
- ❌ Firebase Auth account remains active
- ⚠️ User can log back in with same credentials

**After Setup:**
- ✅ Deletes user data from Firestore
- ✅ Deletes Firebase Auth account completely  
- ✅ User cannot log back in (proper security)

## Testing:
1. Delete a user in admin panel
2. Try to log in with their credentials
3. Should fail with "user not found" error

## Security Notes:
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Keep service account key secure
- Only admin users can delete others
- Deletion is permanent and irreversible
