3. **Start Small**: Begin with 1-2 goals and build momentum
4. **Be Realistic**: Choose goals you can actually achieve

### **Daily Check-ins**
1. **Be Honest**: Rate your day truthfully, not ideally
2. **Be Consistent**: Check in at the same time each day
3. **Be Reflective**: Use the reflection to learn from both successes and setbacks
4. **Be Kind**: Don't judge yourself harshly for difficult days

### **Using Analytics**
1. **Look for Patterns**: Notice what days you rate higher/lower
2. **Identify Trends**: Are you improving over time?
3. **Adjust Goals**: Use insights to refine your goals
4. **Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge your improvements
